    "question": "Hello, can you please help me solve this problem. John has 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms and there are 2 windows in each bedroom. \
    Each house has 1 kitchen with 2 windows. Also, each house has 5 windows that are not in the bedrooms or kitchens. \
    How many windows are there in John's houses?",
    "answer":
"""
Clues:
1. Find the number of bedroom windows, kitchen windows, and other windows separately.
2. Add them together to find the total number of windows at each house.
3. Find the total number of windows for all the houses.

Steps:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 windows per house.
- Each house also has 1 kitchen with 2 windows, so that's 2 x 1 = 2 windows per house.
- Each house has 5 windows that are not in the bedrooms or kitchens, so that's 5 x 1 = 5 windows per house.
- In total, each house has 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 windows.
- Since John has 2 houses, he has a total of 2 x 13 = 26 windows.

Final Answer: 26

    "question": "Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?",
    "answer":
"""
Clues:
1. Start with the total number of chocolates they had.
2. Subtract the number of chocolates they ate.

Steps:
- Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42.
- So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74.
- After eating 35, they had 74 - 35 = 39.

Final Answer: 39

    "question": "Solve the system of equations:\
    1. 2x + 3y = 8 \ 2. x - y = 1",
    "answer":
"""
Clues:
1. Use methods like substitution or elimination.
2. Express x in terms of y from one equation.
3. Plug in the value of x in the other equation to get the value of y.

Steps:
- From equation 2, express x as x = 1+y. Substitute this in equation 1. This yields, 2(1 + y) + 3y = 8 which simplifies to 5y = 6, hence y = 1.2
- Substituting y = 1.2 in equation 2, we get x = 2.2.

Final Answer: x = 2.2, y = 1.2

    "question": "Solve the equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0",
    "answer":
"""
Clues:
1. Factorize the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula.

Steps:
- This quadratic equation can be factored as (x - 2)(x - 2) = 0.
- The solutions are x = 2 (with multiplicity 2).

Final Answer: x = 2 (with multiplicity 2)

   "question": "Suppose three days ago was Tuesday. \
    What day of the week will it be 90 days from today?",
    "answer":
"""
Clues:
1. Determine the number of days between the given day and the desired day.
2. Divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks.
3. Determine the remainder to find the day of the week.

Steps:
- It was Tuesday three days ago, which means today must be Friday.
- The days of the week repeat in sets of 7.
- If today is Friday, then 91 days from now will also be a Friday, since 91 is a multiple of 7.
- Thus, 90 days from now will be the day before Friday, or Thursday.

Final Answer: The day before Friday, or Thursday
